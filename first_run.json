As you&#39;ve noted, &#39;loess&#39; is the more recent program and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;essentially equivalent to &#39;lowess&#39; except that it has more features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The R function &#39;loess&#39; has three things that &#39;lowess&#39; doesn&#39;t:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>It accepts a formula specifying the model rather than the x and y&nbsp;matrices</li>\r\n\t<li>As you&#39;ve noted, it can be used with more than one predictor.</li>\r\n\t<li>It accepts prior weights.</li>\r\n\t<li>It will estimate the &quot;equivalent number of parameters&quot; implied by&nbsp;the&nbsp;fitted curve.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, &#39;loess&#39; is much slower than &#39;lowess&#39; and&nbsp;occasionally&nbsp;fails when &#39;lowess&#39; succeeds, so both programs are kept in R.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When there is only one predictor variable and no prior weights,&nbsp;&#39;lowess&#39;&nbsp;and &#39;loess&#39; are in principle exactly equivalent. However the default&nbsp;settings of the two programs are very different. Here is an example in&nbsp;which I force &#39;lowess&#39; and &#39;loess&#39; to do precisely the same numerical&nbsp;calculation:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n &gt; y &lt;- rnorm(1000)\r\n &gt; x &lt;- 1:1000\r\n &gt; out.lowess &lt;- lowess(x,y,f=0.3,iter=3,delta=0)\r\n &gt; out.lowess$y[1:5]\r\n[1] 0.1816632 0.1799619 0.1782683 0.1765826 0.1749048\r\n &gt; out.loess &lt;- loess(y~x,span=0.3,degree=1,family=&quot;symmetric&quot;,iterations=4,surface=&quot;direct&quot;)\r\n &gt; fitted(out.loess)[1:5]\r\n[1] 0.1816632 0.1799619 0.1782683 0.1765826 0.1749048</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Things to note here:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>&#39;f&#39; is the &#39;span&#39; argument for &#39;lowess&#39;</li>\r\n\t<li>&#39;loess&#39; does quadratic (degree=2) local regression by default&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;linear (degree=1)</li>\r\n\t<li>Unless you specify family=&quot;symmetric&quot;, loess will fit the curve by&nbsp;least&nbsp;squares, i.e., won&#39;t do any robustness iterations at all.</li>\r\n\t<li>lowess and loess count iterations in differently: &#39;iter&#39; in lowess&nbsp;means&nbsp;the number of robustness iterations; &#39;iterations&#39; in loess means the&nbsp;total&nbsp;number of iterations including the least squares fit, i.e.,&nbsp;iterations=iter+1</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The only aspect in which it is not possible to make &#39;loess&#39; and&nbsp;&#39;lowess&#39;&nbsp;agree exactly is in their treatment of large data sets. When x and y&nbsp;are&nbsp;very long, say 10s of thousands of observations, it is impractical and&nbsp;unnecessary to do the local regression calculation exactly, rather it&nbsp;is&nbsp;usual to interpolate between observations that are very close&nbsp;together.&nbsp;This interpolation is controlled by the &#39;delta&#39; argument to &#39;lowess&#39; and by the&nbsp;&#39;cell&#39; and &#39;surface&#39; arguments to &#39;loess&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When there are a large number of observations, &#39;lowess&#39; groups&nbsp;together&nbsp;those x-values that are closer than a certain distance apart.&nbsp;Although&nbsp;grouping observations based on distance is in-principle the best&nbsp;approach,&nbsp;this is impractical for &#39;loess&#39; because &#39;loess&#39; is designed to accept&nbsp;multiple x-variables. So &#39;loess&#39; instead groups observations together based on&nbsp;the&nbsp;number of observations on a cell rather than on distances. Because of&nbsp;this&nbsp;small difference, &#39;lowess&#39; and &#39;loess&#39; will almost always give&nbsp;slightly&nbsp;different numerical results for large data sets. The difference is in favour of lowess but is generally small enough to be unimportant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gordon</p>\r\n",

                    "xhtml": "<p>Local regression is a statistical method for robustly fitting\u00a0smoothing\u00a0curves without prior assumptions about the shape or form of the curve.\u00a0'lowess' and 'loess' are two different functions in R which implement\u00a0local\u00a0regression. As you've noted, 'loess' is the more recent program and it\u00a0is\u00a0essentially equivalent to 'lowess' except that it has more features.</p>\n\n<p>The R function 'loess' has three things that 'lowess' doesn't:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>It accepts a formula specifying the model rather than the x and y\u00a0matrices</li>\n\t<li>As you've noted, it can be used with more than one predictor.</li>\n\t<li>It accepts prior weights.</li>\n\t<li>It will estimate the \"equivalent number of parameters\" implied by\u00a0the\u00a0fitted curve.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>On the other hand, 'loess' is much slower than 'lowess' and\u00a0occasionally\u00a0fails when 'lowess' succeeds, so both programs are kept in R.</p>\n\n<p>When there is only one predictor variable and no prior weights,\u00a0'lowess'\u00a0and 'loess' are in principle exactly equivalent. However the default\u00a0settings of the two programs are very different. Here is an example in\u00a0which I force 'lowess' and 'loess' to do precisely the same numerical\u00a0calculation:</p>\n\n<pre> &gt; y &lt;- rnorm(1000)\n &gt; x &lt;- 1:1000\n &gt; out.lowess &lt;- lowess(x,y,f=0.3,iter=3,delta=0)\n &gt; out.lowess$y[1:5]\n[1] 0.1816632 0.1799619 0.1782683 0.1765826 0.1749048\n &gt; out.loess &lt;- loess(y~x,span=0.3,degree=1,family=\"symmetric\",iterations=4,surface=\"direct\")\n &gt; fitted(out.loess)[1:5]\n[1] 0.1816632 0.1799619 0.1782683 0.1765826 0.1749048</pre>\n\n<p>Things to note here:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>'f' is the 'span' argument for 'lowess'</li>\n\t<li>'loess' does quadratic (degree=2) local regression by default\u00a0instead of\u00a0linear (degree=1)</li>\n\t<li>Unless you specify family=\"symmetric\", loess will fit the curve by\u00a0least\u00a0squares, i.e., won't do any robustness iterations at all.</li>\n\t<li>lowess and loess count iterations in differently: 'iter' in lowess\u00a0means\u00a0the number of robustness iterations; 'iterations' in loess means the\u00a0total\u00a0number of iterations including the least squares fit, i.e.,\u00a0iterations=iter+1</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The only aspect in which it is not possible to make 'loess' and\u00a0'lowess'\u00a0agree exactly is in their treatment of large data sets. When x and y\u00a0are\u00a0very long, say 10s of thousands of observations, it is impractical and\u00a0unnecessary to do the local regression calculation exactly, rather it\u00a0is\u00a0usual to interpolate between observations that are very close\u00a0together.\u00a0This interpolation is controlled by the 'delta' argument to 'lowess' and by the\u00a0'cell' and 'surface' arguments to 'loess'.</p>\n\n<p>When there are a large number of observations, 'lowess' groups\u00a0together\u00a0those x-values that are closer than a certain distance apart.\u00a0Although\u00a0grouping observations based on distance is in-principle the best\u00a0approach,\u00a0this is impractical for 'loess' because 'loess' is designed to accept\u00a0multiple x-variables. So 'loess' instead groups observations together based on\u00a0the\u00a0number of observations on a cell rather than on distances. Because of\u00a0this\u00a0small difference, 'lowess' and 'loess' will almost always give\u00a0slightly\u00a0different numerical results for large data sets. The difference is in favour of lowess but is generally small enough to be unimportant.</p>\n\n<p>Gordon</p>\n"

The data\nincludes three log2(Treated/Control) replicate sets, and a dyeSwap for\neach replicate.   So the design matrix is c(1,-1,1,-1,1-1).

I set the log2Ratio of a gene to\n\"NA\", if its green or red intensity measurement is below background,\nsaturated, low intensity, or non-uniform.
