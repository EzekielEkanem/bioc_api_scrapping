I am hoping to have our new programmer (starting in\n&gt; Jan) learn how to test libraries and to handle all submissions (by\n&gt; doing some simple testing and then add them to a site like CRAN).\n&gt; Do we want to develop and start to populate the site now with the\n&gt; proviso that we will put in more stringent tests later?\n&gt; The reason for this is to gain some momentum and hopefully to find\n&gt; some more people who might be willing to do some of the\norganizational\n&gt; work that will be needed.\n\ni am in favor of deployment soon.  i will be working on getting\ntest-functionality equivalent to Biobase.  pointers on how to get\nthere would be worth writing down.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Fritz/Kurt: is it feasible to set up a web page for bioconductor off\n&gt; of CRAN using mainly the existing structure and to populate it with\n&gt; unvetted software. I expect that the new programmer will be able to\n&gt; take this over in late January. So it would be the initial setup and\n&gt; population that would be required.\n\ni hope this is possible, otherwise we need to get sourceforge\nor anoncvs running locally.  i would put some effort into that\nif i knew that ad hoc security considerations would not lay that\neffort\nto waste at some arbitrary future time\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Organization:\n&gt;    - we need someone (volunteers please take a giant step forward)\nto\n&gt;    organize some mechanism for keeping track of what we are doing\nand\n&gt;    what other people are doing regarding building libraries.\n\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://biowww.dfci.harvard.edu/~bioconductor/\">http://biowww.dfci.harvard.edu/~bioconductor/</a> already has a little\nbit in this regard.  we need to distinguish between internal\ncore-level tracking that can be used for strategizing and\nevaluation and public tracking that is a public service and\nagenda publicity\n\ni am happy to put core-generated changes into the aforementioned\nweb page on short notice.\n\n&gt;    - it would be nice to have some place where one can see what\nsorts\n&gt;    of projects are being done so that collaboration etc can go on.\n&gt;    - perhaps a Wiki type interface?\n\nthis depends upon security.  i will install zope if i can get\na publicly accessible port 8080.  but perhaps that is overkill\nfor a wiki if that is all we really want.\n\nrobert's email is generated from bioconductor-admin, but i made\nthe reply to bioconductor to reach the core.  please advise\nif changes to my mailing strategy are desired.\n\nvince</div>"

I don't have strong feelings on the\nmatter, other than if a standard workflow for determination exists,\nthat I might as well use it.  The context is the DTD describing the\nXML format for a dataset.  I'm tempted to stick it in\n../package/inst/dtd, but was wondering how others have dealt with it.\nI sent the question here, since the number of package developers using\nR XML outside of this particular mailing list seems small.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Me either, somehow I think of it (at least a bit) as data so I\nlike\n&gt; &gt;  package/inst/data\n&gt; &gt;   but almost anything is fine\n&gt; &gt;   we just need to ensure it gets copied over to the installation\n&gt; &gt;   directory so it can get found automatically.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think eventually you would find that it is better to separate the\n&gt; dtd from the data -- i.e. use Tony's original idea of a\n&gt; ../package/inst/dtd directory.\n&gt;\n&gt; One reason for not mixing the DTD and the data is because the DTD\n&gt; tends to be more permanent than the data.  You can be adding or\n&gt; modifying the data sets but the DTD, because it describes a data\n&gt; format, is a more stable description.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, once you have a established and more-or-less finalized the DTD\n&gt; it is handy to make it available from an http server so you can\n&gt; begin the XML file with\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;foo&gt;\n&gt;  ...\n&gt; &lt;/foo&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; and a validating parser will have access to the DTD independently of\n&gt; the file's location.  If you are going to create a collection of\nDTD's\n&gt; under, say, www.bioconductor.org/dtd/ it would be handy to have the\n&gt; DTD's within packages separately accessible and identifiable.\n&gt;\n\n</div>"

But the\n  get/set prefixes are fine.  I would like\n  to see these autogenerated and I hope that things are going in that\n  direction.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My second question is:\n&gt; &gt; In the case my slots have names like 'sd' or 'history', I am\nreally annoyed to\n&gt; &gt; have accessor functions and document them by having '\\alias{sd}'\nor\n&gt; &gt; '\\alias{history} in the '.Rd' file for the class since 'sd' and\n'history' are\n&gt; &gt; functions from 'base'. What should I do (in case the the answer to\nfirst\n&gt; &gt; question was 'yes, we want accessor functions') ?\n&gt;\n&gt; i don't share your annoyance, but the problem of collisions\n&gt; among document references is real.  sd-methods.Rd can be\n&gt; generated via promptMethods.\n&gt;\n&gt; we need some protracted thought about this -- many people are\n&gt; working on documentation concepts but at this time you just\n&gt; have to strike a balance between thoroughness and annoyance-\nreduction\n&gt;\n&gt; sorry!\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ???\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; L.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Laurent Gautier                     CBS, Building 208, DTU\n&gt; &gt; PhD.

If you get the\n&gt;&gt;   working directory right all is well and good -- otherwise you're\n&gt;&gt;   toast. Jianhua did this in some of the early versions and it\ncould\n&gt;&gt;   be reinstated.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   If you think about the example below, usually I have the cdf\nfiles\n&gt;&gt;   in one place and the cel files in another -- I want to select\nboth\n&gt;&gt;   at one time == navigation\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 2 - is is possible to have an argument, say text=\"\", that lets\nyou add\n&gt;&gt; &gt; test that will apear on the widget? for example i would have it\nsay\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \"choose ond cdf file and any cel file you want to read in\"\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;    That should be pretty straight forward.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    Instructions: (paste your text here).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   good ideas -- thanks Rafael.\n&gt;&gt;  (but please -- bioconductor is the place for discussions)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Biocore mailing list\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Biocore@stat.math.ethz.ch\n&gt;&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/biocore\">http://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/biocore</a>\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --\n&gt;&gt; +------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------+\n&gt;&gt; | Robert Gentleman                 phone : (617) 632-5250\n|\n&gt;&gt; | Associate Professor              fax:   (617)  632-2444\n|\n&gt;&gt; | Department of Biostatistics      office: M1B28\n&gt;&gt; | Harvard School of Public Health  email:\nrgentlem@jimmy.dfci.harvard.edu   |\n&gt;&gt; +------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------+\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_______________________________________________\n&gt;Biocore mailing list\n&gt;Biocore@stat.math.ethz.ch\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/biocore\">http://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/biocore</a>\n</div>"
